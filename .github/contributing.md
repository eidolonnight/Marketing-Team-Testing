The Marketing team focuses on making WordPress marketable in all sorts of contexts, from the WordPress.org side all the way to core and the wider community. We market WordPress and its community to the wider world.

## When does the Global Marketing Team meet?

We meet at each Wednesday. Time zones and daylight savings time makes that the meeting time in UTC shifts a few times a year. Please check our actual meeting time at the top of this page. We meet in the #marketing Slack Channel.

## Who are we

The Make WordPress global marketing team consists of people who are passionate about WordPress. Our contributors work in social media, digital marketing, analytics, and other related fields. We’re writers. We’re analysts. We’re communicators. We crave data and we love learning about human behavior.
